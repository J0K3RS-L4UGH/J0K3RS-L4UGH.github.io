        <h1>Ricing</h1>
        <p>Ricing is the heavy customisation of a desktop. Here I will make a very quick guide on how to start Linux ricing, but if you want a more extensive guide, you can find it <a href="https://thatnixguy.github.io/posts/ricing">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>1. Choose a Distro</h3>
        <p>First, of course, you need to choose a distro. Popular ones are Arch, Manjaro, Debian and Nix. I use Kali, because I enjoy HTB and only have space for 1 Virtual Machine (My host machine is Windows), but I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time ricer.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>2. Choose a Desktop Environment</h3>
        <p>This means 'a graphical users interface (GUI) that enables a user to access and manage the important and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system.'. The popuar ones are GNOME, KDE and XFCE. Personally, I like KDE.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>3. Choose your taskbar and configure it.</h3>
        <p>Sorry, bit of a confusing section name, but i mean the bar which displays the apps you pin to it. I use the default KDE Plasma one, but other ones are availiable, like <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar">Polybar</a>. Then you can add widgets, like a clock, a RAM manager, pin apps to it, and add your power buttons.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>4. Choose a wallpaper</h3>
        <p>This can be overlooked a lot of the time, but a good rice NEEDS a good wallpaper. There are sites that can help you with this.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>5. Install apps of your choice</h3>
        <p>Things like Neofetch, Sunamu, Visual Studio Code, Firefox and VLC can all be good.</p>

        <h3>Done! now take a screenshot and feel good about yourself :)</h3>
