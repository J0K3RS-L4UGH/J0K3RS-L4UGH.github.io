        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <p>Linux is an operating system based off unix. It is like a puzzlein a way; it is so user-controlled that so many things can go wrong, but when they do, you can fix them. This will be a very quick explanation of some of the seperate main topics.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Choosing a distro</h3>
        <p>Depending on your wants and needs, there are different distributions. Arch is heavily customisable, Kali is for hackers, Ubuntu is for avarage users, etc...</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>The filesystem</h3>
        <p>Linux filesystem is contained in the / folder. this contains things like bin, which contains executables, home, which contains the different users home directories, and root, which contains the root users directories</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>The root user</h3>
        <p>The root user has complete access to the machine, including each of the seperate users' home directory, and does not need to use sudo.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Simple commands</h3>
        <p>ls- lists all files in a directory</p>
        <p>cd- switches your current directory to the specified one</p>
        <p>cat- prints all the contents of the specified file</p>
        <p>rm- deletes the specified files, using the -r switch can also remove directories</p>
