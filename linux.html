        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <p>Linux is an operating system based off Unix. It is very user-controlled so many things can go wrong, but when they do, you can fix them (most of the time). This will be a very quick explanation of some of the seperate main topics.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Choosing a distro</h3>
        <p>Depending on your wants and needs, there are different distributions. Arch is heavily customisable, Kali is for hackers, Ubuntu is meant to be easy to use, etc...</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>The filesystem</h3>
        <p>Linux filesystem is contained in the / folder. This contains things like <code>bin</code>, which contains executables, <code>home</code>, which contains the different users' home directories, and <code>root</code>, which contains the root users' directories.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>The root user</h3>
        <p>The root user has complete access to the machine, including each of the seperate users' home directory, and does not need to use <code>sudo</code>.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Simple commands</h3>
        <p><code>ls</code>- lists all files in a directory</p>
        <p><code>cd</code>- switches your current directory to the specified one</p>
        <p><code>cat</code>- prints all the contents of the specified file</p>
        <p><code>rm</code>- deletes the specified files, using the <code>-r</code> switch can also remove directories</p>
